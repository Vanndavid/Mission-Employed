# MISSION: EMPLOYED 🚀

**Mission: Employed** is a high-performance execution dashboard designed for software engineers who treat the job search as a mechanical process rather than an emotional one. Built on a foundation of disciplined protocols and powered by Google Gemini AI, it removes decision fatigue and replaces it with cold, calculated execution.

---

## 🎯 THE MISSION STATEMENT
The modern software engineering job market is noisy, biased, and demoralizing. This application operates on a single axiom: **"Execution is the only variable you control."** By quantifying your search into daily "Protocols," you bypass the cognitive load of emotional analysis and maintain the volume required to win.

## 🛠 CORE OPERATIONAL MODULES

### 1. 🚀 Mission Control (Daily Dashboard)
*   **Protocol Tracking**: A non-negotiable daily checklist covering LeetCode targets, behavioral drills, and interview simulations.
*   **Coding Tutor (Gemini 3 Pro)**: A stateful, AI-powered mentor that provides Socratic guidance on algorithm and system design problems. It won't give you the answer; it will force you to find it.
*   **Persistence Visualizer**: A 28-day heat map and streak tracker to measure your discipline. In this search, a broken streak is a failed mission.

### 2. 📁 The Pipeline (Mechanical Applying)
*   **Strict Filtering**: Define up to 8 custom criteria (e.g., "Not FAANG," "SQL Involved," "Small-mid size").
*   **Binary Decision Making**: Use the "AI Job Scan" to analyze JDs against your criteria. If the role scores below your Target Score (e.g., 4/8), the mission is aborted. No exceptions.
*   **Zero-Emotion Tracking**: Move applications through a streamlined kanban-style list without over-analyzing rejection.

### 3. 🧠 Training Room (Behavioral Prep)
*   **The Fact Database**: A central repository for your "Raw Truths"—bullets of actual impact you've made, failures you've survived, and disagreements you've resolved.
*   **Dual-Mode Simulation**:
    *   **Voice Mode**: Real-time recording with Gemini 2.5 Native Audio transcription and TTS question delivery.
    *   **Text Mode**: For focused "Tactical Writing" and narrative structuring using the STAR method.
*   **Executive Review**: Receive brutal, unbiased performance analysis. The AI recruiter identifies rambling, lack of impact, and structural failures.
*   **Gauntlet Mode**: Execute a full 6-theme mock interview with a final hire/no-hire verdict and narrative consistency report.

### 4. 📜 The Codex (Mental Guardrails)
*   **Operational Constraints**: A list of "Dont's" to prevent strategy-shifting and procrastination (e.g., "No comparing yourself to ideal candidates").
*   **Discipline Directives**: "Dos" to keep your focus on metrics rather than feelings.
*   **Emergency Protocol**: A specialized interface for high-stress periods, providing immediate, tactical steps to reset your mental state and resume the mission.

## 🏗 THE 3-PHASE STRATEGY

1.  **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering**: Fill your Behavioral Database and refine your criteria. Freeze your CV.
2.  **Phase 2: Mechanical Volume**: Execute the daily checklist. Apply to at least 2 roles that meet your score. Zero post-application analysis.
3.  **Phase 3: Tactical Interviewing**: Use the Training Room to convert your Database facts into fluid, spoken narratives.

## 🛑 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
If you feel the urge to "take a week off" or "pivot your stack," navigate immediately to **The Codex** and trigger the **Emergency Protocol**. The system will guide you back to the next 5 minutes of execution.

*Built for those who refuse to wait for luck. Execution is everything.*
