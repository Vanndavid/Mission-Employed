# Mission: Employed 🚀

**Mission: Employed** is a high-performance execution dashboard designed for software engineers who treat the job search as a mechanical process rather than an emotional one. Built on a foundation of disciplined protocols and powered by Google Gemini AI, it removes decision fatigue and replaces it with cold, calculated execution.

## 🛠 Core Protocols

### 🧩 Coding Protocol (Mission Control)
*   **Targeted Practice:** Generate algorithm and system design problems categorized by difficulty (Easy/Medium).
*   **AI Assessment:** Receive unbiased, critical feedback on logic, time/space complexity, and edge cases with zero sugar-coating.
*   **Streak Tracking:** Monitor everyday consistency with an integrated progress visualizer and milestone tracker.

### 🧠 Behavioral & Simulation Protocol (Training Room)
*   **Fact Archive:** Maintain a database of raw, data-driven facts for key behavioral themes (Weakness, Challenge, Failure, Impact).
*   **Simulation Environment:** Practice timed verbal responses to dynamically generated behavioral challenges.
*   **Live Transcription:** Integrated real-time audio recording and transcription powered by Gemini's native audio-to-text capabilities.
*   **Executive Review:** Receive high-stakes, unbiased critiques of your delivery, STAR structure, and missed opportunities for impact.

### 📁 Pipeline Protocol (Mechanical Applying)
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Define your own custom evaluation criteria (e.g., salary range, company size, tech stack).
*   **AI Job Scan:** Automatically analyze job descriptions against your custom criteria to identify "elite-status" signals or algorithm-heavy traps.
*   **Mission Logging:** Track application status with a zero-emotion, high-visibility interface.

### 📜 The Codex
*   **Non-Negotiable Rules:** A dedicated section for mental guardrails (Dos and Don'ts) designed to prevent "strategy-shifting" and emotional burnout.
*   **Emergency Protocol:** A specialized mode for handling emotional interference or burnout during high-stress search periods.

## 💻 Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React 19 (Modern ES modules)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Optimized for Dark/Light modes)
*   **Intelligence:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) - utilized for content generation, speech analysis, and job description scoring.
*   **Native Integration:** Web Audio API for PCM streaming and MediaDevices API for real-time microphone capture.
*   **Persistence:** LocalStorage-based state persistence with native JSON Export/Import functionality for data portability.

## 🎯 The Philosophy

The modern software engineering job market is noisy and demoralizing. **Mission: Employed** operates on the principle that *Applying is mechanical, not strategic.* 

By quantifying the process into daily "Protocols," the user maintains high output and avoids the cognitive load of "emotional analysis." This is not a project for browsing—it is a tool for executing until the mission is complete.
